Projects:

FlexAndQNX - Flash Builder 4 Flex AIR project showcasing how to use QNX in Flex app with MXML.
NonFlexMXMLUsingQNX - Flash Builder 4 AIR project using MXML and QNX but not Flex components.

Dependencies:
BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK 0.9.1 Beta 2
Flex 4.1 or higher

Description:
These classes are "as is". They are not complete but work for the basic use case. They may 
or may not be developed further. They are meant to show what could work and there is plenty 
of stuff might have issues. Having said that... what is this?

QNX UI Components are the UI components used in the BlackBerry Tablet OS which runs on the
PlayBook tablet. The QNX components is a AS3 component library. I extended QNX Container class
to allow for usage in MXML. MXML is not Flex, you can use MXML with no Flex components. That is 
what I did here. I made the QApplication and QContainer to be used in MXML for both non-Flex apps
and Flex apps.

The examples both reference the QMXML.swc.

Here is a simple Non-Flex QNX UI app with one button:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<r:QApplication xmlns:r="http://ns.renaun.com/mxml/2010" 
				xmlns:fx="http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"
				xmlns:buttons="qnx.ui.buttons.*">
	<buttons:Button />
</r:QApplication>
